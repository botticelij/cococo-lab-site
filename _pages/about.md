The **CoCoCo Lab** at Cornell University studies how perception and cognition are shaped by experience, culture, and rapidly changing technologies. We are interested in how cultural systems evolve over time, why they vary across populations, and which aspects may be universal. Our work connects human participants, artificial agents, and large cultural datasets in order to understand how minds and societies change together.

Our research builds on previous work in computational auditory perception and mental representations, extending these ideas to a broader range of modalities, tasks, and environments. We combine large-scale experimentation, computational modeling, and fieldwork to map the structure of internal representations and the dynamics of cultural evolution across the globe.

## Research Themes

### 1. Simulated virtual worlds and hybrid societies

Emerging AI systems are reshaping collective behavior. As humans and AI agents interact within shared networks, their influence on one another can be nonlinear and difficult to observe with traditional methods. We build simulated worlds and programmable social networks where we can precisely control the rules of interaction, track how ideas and behaviors spread, and study how hybrid societies of humans and AI evolve over time.

We ask questions such as: When do groups become more creative or intelligent than their individual members? How do incentives, network structure, and AI assistance change cooperation and exploration? How should we design hybrid human–AI systems that are both effective and aligned with human values?

### 2. Universality and diversity of human culture

Most behavioral research still relies on participants from a small number of industrialized countries. This makes it difficult to separate truly universal aspects of human cognition from the consequences of shared exposure and experience. We address this challenge by combining large-scale online experiments with fieldwork in diverse communities around the world.

We study how people from different cultural backgrounds perceive music, language, color, and other complex stimuli, and how these perceptions relate to their everyday environments. We also analyze large cultural datasets (for example, music listening behaviour at scale) to track how cultural patterns emerge, change, and respond to global events.

### 3. Internal representations and human–machine comparisons

Perception is high-dimensional and context-dependent, but many classic experiments probe only a few hand-picked stimuli or features at a time. Inspired by methods from machine learning and statistical physics, we develop adaptive sampling techniques that let us explore rich stimulus spaces efficiently. By treating human judgments as samples from an internal “perceptual prior”, we can recover detailed maps of how people represent sounds, images, and other complex stimuli.

We are also interested in how these human representations relate to those learned by modern machine learning models, including large language models and multimodal systems. Comparing human and machine representations helps us understand both: it reveals which aspects of human cognition are captured (or missed) by current models, and provides new tools for building systems that are interpretable, robust, and aligned w
