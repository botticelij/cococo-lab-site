I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Cornell University. My research focuses on understanding culture. I address this many-faceted topic with new tools, both by applying machine learning techniques to behavioral experiments and to big data, and by expanding the scale and scope of experimental research via massive online experiments and fieldwork in locations around the globe. I completed my Ph.D. at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Naftali Tishby and Merav Ahissar, followed by postdoctoral positions at Josh McDermott's Computational Audition Lab at MIT, at Tom Griffiths's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at UC Berkeley, and as a Presidential Scholar in Society and Neuroscience at Columbia University. Before coming to Cornell I was a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt am Main.
